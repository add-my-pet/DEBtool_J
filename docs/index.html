<h1>DEBtool_J</h1> 

<p>Welcome to a first version of a new DEBtool repository coded in free open source language  <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> . </p>
 
 <p>
We aim to build an efficient, working minimalist version of the AMP procedure in Julia with the help of anyone who’s keen. We’ve found it a useful exercise to a) learn Julia and b) better understand how DEBtool works! Julia and Matlab are much more similar to each other than Matlab is to R. This is a useful doc to read though because there are some important differences: <a href = "https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/">https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/ </a>
</p>
 
<p>
Please see the <a href="https://github.com/BiophysicalEcology">BiophysicalEcology</a>  repo in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>  language. There’s a rather impressive repo on <a href="https://github.com/CliMA/">climate modelling</a>, including ocean dynamics (the <a href="https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/">Oceananigans’</a>‘ package) that gives a good sense of what’s possible in <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>  and how energy and mass exchange models could be linked together in the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>  framework.
</p>

<p>
In terms of speed, it should end up being a lot faster – close to what it would be if it were written in C or Fortran, but there will be subtle things that need doing to optimise how it compiles (e.g., perhaps not using globals, and using immutable structs rather than the mutable ones I’ve used, and ‘inlining’ things here and there). You can also compile Julia for working on GPUs.
</p>
 
<p>
This is as a long-term initiative and we fully realise how much work is involved, we think it’s worth a few of us plugging away at it because <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> does seem to be the way of the future for scientific computing (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01832-z">see  this paper for an interesting perspective on this</a>).

It uses the Emydura maquaryii turtle as the example, for no particular reason. I have it working all the way until the call of results_pets.

It produces (almost) identical results to the Matlab version. But it is a fair bit slower at the moment. There will be ways to speed it up I’m sure. And the way I’ve set up the pars_init file is not idea – there will be a way to use <a href="https://github.com/rafaqz/ModelParameters.jl">Raf Schouten’s ModelParameters.jl package</a> to do this much better (and probably will gain a lot of extra speed as a result). But I wanted to just get something that works at all first.

<p>
The other very nice thing about Julia is <code>‘multiple dispatch’</code>, where you create different versions of a function with the same name (these different versions are called <code>‘methods’</code> of that function) that dispatch according to the <code>‘types’</code> and numbers of arguments. So, as a somewhat trivial example, you could e.g. create different versions of tempcorr that dispatch differently depending on how many input arguments there are. Instead of large functions with lots of if/else or case setups in your code, you just made version of the same function that dispatch differently depending on the arguments and their types.

<p>
A big aspect of how this works is because of the hierarchical type system in <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>. You can define abstract types (beyond e.g. real, float, int64, to have e.g. a abstract type of ‘DEBmodel’, and have ‘std’, ‘abp’, etc. as sub-types. And when structs of parameters of those different types are passed as arguments to functions, the particular versions of the functions relevant to ‘std’, ‘abp’, are used. The ‘multiple’ part of multiple dispatch is that it looks at all the type of ALL arguments passed to a function and dispatches on the most specific version of that function.

<a href="pars_init_Emydura_macquarii_ModelParametersStyle.jl">Here</a> is an example of how it would look setting the <code>pars_init</code>
 file up with it. It looks a lot more like how it is set up in Matlab, as opposed to the way I made the pars_init file in the current DEBtool_J. So, the idea would be to make DEBtools_J extremely similar to DEBtools_M. But to make it take advantage of the performance of Julia there will be some tweaks, including how structs are set up. 

If you want to play around with it you should probably use VS Code – that seems to be the best IDE and it has an attractive debugging system. The procedure would be to install Julia and VS Code, then click on the  symbol in VS Code and click the <code>‘run_Emydura_macquarii.jl’</code> in the <code>‘‘example’</code> folder.
</p>‘clone repository’</code> button, and put in the URL to the repo so it can download to your computer. Then type <code>‘julia’</code> in the VS Code terminal to start a Julia session, type the ] key to turn on the package manager (backspace goes back to the Julia REPL), and type:

<code>
activate 
instantiate
</code>

and then run <code>‘run_Emydura_macquarii.jl’</code> in the <code>‘‘example’</code> folder.
</p>
 
<p>
That should install all the dependencies, which includes DifferentialEquations.jl which takes a long time to install. And note that there is always quite a lag when you first run anything in Julia because it compiles everything at the start, and is then fast from then on.
